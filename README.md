# Open Link in Other Window

This extension adds a context menu for opening links in other window. Great for people
who use multiple monitor setup, running more than one instance of Firefox.

Planned update:

* i18n
* Option to open the link in a background tab

Bug reports and suggestions are highly appreciated :))
