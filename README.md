# Open Link in Other Window

This extension adds a context menu for opening links in other window. Great for people
who use multiple monitor setup, running more than one instance of Firefox.

Features:

* Option to open the link in a foreground or background tab, with the consideration
that other window's active tab is playing media
* i18n, contribution is greatly appreciated (they're only 10 lines :wink:)

Bug reports and suggestions are highly appreciated :smile:
